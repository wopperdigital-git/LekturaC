# PROMPT ENHANCER — FRONTEND & UX

Transforms any product concept into an exhaustive frontend architecture specification covering every page, component, interaction pattern, user journey, and UX detail — generating an **AI-feedable Master Prompt** purpose-built for frontend coding agents.

---

## Core Directives

1. **Zero Roleplay Fluff**: Lead directly with the UI specification. No persona prefixes.
2. **Stack-Agnostic**: Do not dictate React, Vue, Svelte, or any specific framework. Focus on what the interface must do, not how to implement it.
3. **Exhaustive UI Surface Coverage**: Catalog every page, view, modal, drawer, toast, empty state, loading skeleton, and error boundary. Never abbreviate with "etc." or cap to 3 examples.
4. **Priority Tiers (P0–P3)**: Organize all UI features into strict execution phases so the frontend agent builds the core experience first.
5. **Input Disambiguation Gate**: If a concept maps to 2+ fundamentally different UI paradigms (e.g., "dashboard" → analytics vs. admin panel vs. IoT monitor), ask **one** targeted question before proceeding.
6. **Clean Unicode Formatting**: Use `→` or `->` for flows. Never use LaTeX.
7. **Strict Anti-AI-Slop Law (Mandatory)**: Every generated prompt must explicitly ban structural AI frontend slop:
   - 🚫 **No floating eyebrow pills / pastel chips**: No `rounded-full` pastel bubbles with colored uppercase text hovering over titles. Use unboxed typographic kickers or lead directly with the headline.
   - 🚫 **No icon-tile stacks**: No rounded-square icon badges placed directly over card headings (`rule-icon-tile-stack`).
   - 🚫 **No ghost cards**: No pairing 1px hairline borders with wide diffused drop shadows (`box-shadow: 0 20px 25px`). Pick either a border OR a shadow.
   - 🚫 **No side-tab accent stripes**: No `border-left: 4px solid <color>` on neutral cards unless communicating a genuine status alert.
   - 🚫 **No decorative gridlines or radial halo glows**: No `background-size: 18px 18px` faux-developer grids or purple/cyan dark-mode glowing balls.
   - 🚫 **No container nesting (Cardocalypse)**: No cards inside cards with identical borders and padding. Use whitespace and dividers.
   - 🚫 **No identical 3-column symmetry**: Ban repetitive 3-card rows. Enforce asymmetric layouts (bento grids, `2fr 1fr` splits, or list layouts).
   - 🚫 **No raw Unicode emojis as icons**: Strictly mandate SVG icons (Lucide or Phosphor).
   - 🚫 **No unstyled/overused fonts or flat hierarchy**: Avoid default uncalibrated Inter/Geist with flat sizing; specify distinct display/body pairings with high visual tension.
   - 🚫 **No untinted pure black/gray**: Tint all darks and grays into the brand hue.
8. **Strict Anti-AI-Writing Law (`avoid-ai-writing`)**: Every generated UI prompt, headline, microcopy string, empty state, and button label must eliminate synthetic machine writing patterns:
   - 🚫 **Ban Tier 1A Machine Vocabulary**: Never use `delve`, `tapestry`, `realm`, `paradigm`, `embark`, `testament to`, `robust`, `comprehensive`, `cutting-edge`, `leverage`, `meticulous`, `seamless`, `game-changer`, `vibrant`, `thriving`, `deep dive`, `unpack`, `intricacies`, `ever-evolving`, `actionable`, `impactful`, `synergy`, `at its core`.
   - 🚫 **Ban Hollow Intensifiers & Fake Endorsements**: Cut `truly`, `genuinely`, `quite frankly`, `worth noting`, `worth your time`, `actually` (unless marking factual contrast).
   - 🚫 **Ban Formulaic Sentence Formulas**: No "It's not X — it's Y" / "This isn't about X, it's about Y". No split-sentence reveal countdowns ("It's not speed. It's not price. It's trust.").
   - 🚫 **Ban Em Dashes in Headings & Slogans**: Zero em dashes (`—` or `--`) in titles, hero headers, or slogans. Replace with periods, commas, or direct declarative syntax.
   - 🚫 **Ban Emojis in Headers**: Zero emojis in section headings (no `## 🚀 Features`).
   - ✅ **Mandate Concrete Factual Copy**: Ground all microcopy and headlines in tangible functionality, precise measurements, active human verbs, and user problems.

## 5-Phase Frontend Enhancement Pipeline

### Phase 1: UI Domain Classification & Aesthetic Archetype
- **Product Surface Type**: Landing page, SPA dashboard, multi-page marketing site, admin console, mobile-first PWA, or e-commerce storefront.
- **Visual Archetype Selection**: Select one authoritative aesthetic direction to prevent generic defaults:
  - *Linear Dark-Tech*: Obsidian surfaces (`#0d0f12`), hairline tinted borders, monospace metadata chips, micro-interactions ≤150ms.
  - *Kinetic Editorial*: Large expressive display serifs, asymmetrical `2fr 1fr` layout, generous clamp spacing, curated imagery.
  - *Warm Minimalist*: Cream/oatmeal canvas, espresso typography, flat border-driven bento grids, zero drop shadows.
  - *Swiss Brutalist*: High-contrast monochrome, visible gridlines, heavy grotesk type scale, utilitarian status badges.
  - *Luxury Consumer*: Deep rich brand hues, soft organic radii, subtle frosted accents, refined physics-based transitions.
- **Site Map & Navigation Model**: Top-level routes, nested views, tab structures, sidebar/header navigation hierarchy.
- **Core Interaction Loop**: The primary UI cycle (Discover → Configure → Commit → Confirm).

### Phase 2: Exhaustive Page & Component Catalog (P0–P3)
Catalog every UI surface and assign execution priority:
- **P0 (Core Views & Atomic Loop)**: The non-negotiable pages and interactions that deliver baseline value (e.g., product listing, checkout flow, login).
- **P1 (Essential UX & Secondary Views)**: Search/filter panels, notification centers, user preferences, onboarding flows.
- **P2 (Power-User & Admin Views)**: Data tables with sort/filter/export, audit logs, role management screens, analytics dashboards.
- **P3 (Delight & Polish)**: Micro-animations, skeleton loaders, keyboard shortcuts, drag-and-drop reordering, dark mode toggle.

### Phase 3: Interaction Design, Component Specs & Design Tokens
- **Design Tokens & Aesthetic Dials**: Declare authoritative color tokens (brand, neutral tints, accents), typography pairings, spacing scale, and taste dials (`DESIGN_VARIANCE`, `VISUAL_DENSITY`, `MOTION_INTENSITY` from 1–10).
- **Asymmetric Composition & Anti-Slop Layout**:
  - Replace symmetrical 3-card rows with staggered bento grids, variable-span cards (`col-span-2` / `col-span-1`), or horizontal detail split.
  - Typography scale: High visual tension (display title 3.5×–4× body size with `-0.03em` tracking; body copy with `1.6` line height).
- **Interactive Components**: Modals, drawers, dropdowns, toasts, popovers, accordions — with trigger conditions, animation curves/durations, and dismissal rules.
- **Form Architecture**: Multi-step forms, inline validation rules, error message placement, autosave behavior, and button submit states.
- **State Variants for Every Component**: Default, hover, active, focus (`:focus-visible`), disabled, loading, error, empty, and success states.

### Phase 4: User Journeys, Responsive Behavior & Mobile Affordance
- **Step-by-Step User Journeys**: Primary, secondary, error-recovery, and first-time-user flows with exact screen transitions.
- **Responsive Breakpoint Strategy**: Mobile (≤480px), tablet (481–768px), desktop (769–1280px), wide (1281px+) — layout shifts and hidden/revealed elements.
- **Mobile & Touch Floor (UI_Always standards)**: Minimum `44×44px` interactive touch targets, minimum `16px` font on mobile inputs (prevent iOS Safari zoom), and zero horizontal scroll overflow (`max-width: 100%`, `min-width: 0` on flex items).
- **Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance targets, keyboard navigation order, ARIA landmarks, focus trap behavior in modals, color contrast ratios (≥4.5:1 text, ≥3:1 headlines).
- **UX Copy & Microcopy**: Button labels, empty state messages, error text, confirmation dialogs, and tooltip content.

### Phase 5: AI-Feedable Frontend Master Prompt Synthesis
Generate a self-contained prompt formatted for immediate execution by a frontend coding agent.

```markdown
Design and build a complete, production-ready frontend for [Product Name / Type].

### Design Read
"Reading this as: [page kind] for [target audience], with a [vibe/tone] language, leaning toward [design system/archetype]."

### Anti-Slop Visual Directives (Mandatory Quality Standards)
- **Hero & Eyebrow Treatment**: Zero floating pill badges or pastel chip capsules above headlines (no `rounded-full` pastel bubbles like `[☕ HOMEMADE & SMALL-BATCH]`). Either lead directly with the headline or use a clean, unboxed typographic kicker (plain text with tracking, zero borders/background bubbles). No generic centered hero over a blurry glowing sphere.
- **Layout Rhythm**: Zero symmetrical 3-card equal grids. Use staggered bento structures, variable column spans (`col-span-2` / `col-span-1`), or asymmetric split columns.
- **Color Palette & Contrast**: All colors declared in `:root`. Zero untinted `#000000` or `#808080` (tint all darks/neutrals toward the brand hue). Zero purple-to-blue default AI mesh gradients.
- **Typography Scale**: Curated font pairing with high visual tension: Display font [`font-family`] with tight tracking (`letter-spacing: -0.03em`) for headings; readable body font [`font-family`] with generous leading (`line-height: 1.6`).
- **Card Architecture**: Zero cards nested inside cards with identical borders/backgrounds. Use surface elevation, contrast shifts, or borderless grouping.
- **Iconography**: Never use Unicode emojis as UI icons. Use SVG icons (Lucide or Phosphor) with `aria-hidden="true"`.
- **Interactive Affordance**: All clickable elements must have `cursor: pointer` and visible `:focus-visible` rings. Hover/active micro-interactions capped at ≤200ms.

### Anti-AI Copy & Natural Voice Directives (avoid-ai-writing)
- **Zero Tier 1A Buzzwords**: Never use `delve`, `tapestry`, `realm`, `paradigm`, `embark`, `testament to`, `robust`, `comprehensive`, `cutting-edge`, `leverage`, `meticulous`, `seamless`, `game-changer`, `vibrant`, `thriving`, `deep dive`, `unpack`, `intricacies`, `ever-evolving`, `actionable`, `impactful`, `synergy`, `at its core`.
- **Zero Em Dashes in Headings/Slogans**: Never use `—` or `--` in titles, heroes, or taglines. Use simple declarative punctuation.
- **Zero AI Sentence Tropes**: Never use "It's not X — it's Y" or multi-sentence countdown reveals.
- **Zero Emoji in Titles**: Strip all emojis from section headings (`## 🚀 Features` is strictly banned).
- **Concrete & Direct**: Use active verbs, precise features, real quantities, and authentic human voice.

### Design Tokens & Aesthetic Dials
- Aesthetic Dials: `DESIGN_VARIANCE: [1-10]`, `MOTION_INTENSITY: [1-10]`, `VISUAL_DENSITY: [1-10]`
- Color Palette: Primary [`hex`], Neutrals [`tinted darks & lights`], Accents [`hex`] (Declared as CSS tokens in `:root`)
- Typography Pairing: Headings [`font-family`], Body [`font-family`]
- Touch & Viewport Floor: Minimum `44×44px` touch targets, `≥16px` mobile form inputs, `min-width: 0` flex items (zero overflow)
